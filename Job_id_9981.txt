description: TechCrunch is hiring web developers!  

We want to grow our (at this time) small but intense technical team to build out the next generation of products and features on our network of blogs and websites. Your job will be to Get Things Done on these projects as well as eventually tell us what we absolutely need to be focused on next (and why).

Required Skills

- Experience developing in Ruby

- Strong experience working with Rails - ideally you've worked full-time on Rails or have side-projects that you've built from scratch

- Solid understanding of ActiveRecord, Associations, Routing, Migrations, Caching principles and practices, and the whole nine yards

- MySQL

- CSS [sass]

- HTML [haml]

- Experience/Knowledge in Git

- Love of the web: protocols, platforms, languages

- Javascript, JQuery, Ajax

- Experience working with Linux servers, Rails application deployment, and so forth

 

What you'll get:

- A competitive salary

- Health benefits - medical, dental, and vision

- 401K

- Stock

- The ability to work in San Francisco

- Free Lunch on M/F

- Free access to all TechCrunch conferences/events [You'll probably help plan them as well]

- A bunch of other nice perks

 

Why work at TechCrunch?

By joining the team as a developer, you'll be an intricate part of working on projects that will have massive impact on millions of our readers and users.  Your voice will be heard and you'll have a lot of autonomy over mission-critical decisions.  Our office culture is relaxed yet dynamic, located in the SOMA district of San Francisco within walking distance of CalTrain (perfect for commuting!).  Everyday, amazingly interesting people walk in and out of our doors making for a really exciting working environment.
