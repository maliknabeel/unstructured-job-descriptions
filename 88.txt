Job Description:

FULLY FUNDED PhD POSITIONS IN THE AREA OF ANALYZING BIG ENTERPRISE DATA

The Enterprise Data Management Cluster of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University 
and the University of Mannheim has several open PhD positions in cooperation with industrial 
partners (e.g, SAP and fluidOperations).

Today, not only internet companies do have Big Data! Also classical information systems of 
enterprises store huge amounts of mostly structured data (called Big Enterprise Data) 
that needs to be analyzed. In this context, we are looking into the problem how to extend 
classical databases in order to support complex analytic tasks on Big Enterprise Data in a scalable 
and robust way. Another challenge in this context is secure and efficient data integration 
over Big Enterprise Data with thousands of tables in different distributed data sources.

If your passion is designing and building data management systems that push the state of the 
art and you enjoy working on challenging and relevant research problems, please send your 
application (motivation letter, CV, copy of degrees) to Prof. Carsten Binnig 
(carsten.binnig@dhbw-mannheim.de).

Applicants must have a master degree in computer science or a related field
with an overall grade better than 2.0 (on a German grading scale) and a strong 
background in implementing complex systems.
