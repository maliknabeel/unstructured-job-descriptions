Job Description:

Subject: Extraction, structuring and management of semantic annotation

Studentship Code: ECS8

Semantic Computing seeks to leverage information and communication technologies 
in all computer mediated forms of interactions and communications in an ecosystem 
of data, humans and machines. We are currently contribute to a variety of contemporary 
information and communication challenges in society, business and industry, such as 
Named Entity Recognition, semantic multimedia, text analytics, cross-lingual information 
retrieval, algorithms and conceptual structures, cognitive semantics and theory of meaning, 
semantic classification and annotation, formal concept analysis and lattice theory. 

Your proposed research should aspire to continue on or complement successfully funded 
projects, e.g., UK Technology Strategy Board in collaboration with London businesses 
and industry, as well as other currently running PhD projects in this thematic area. 
You should bring robust knowledge in one or more of the following subject areas:

-	algorithms and data/conceptual structures design and implementation, 
-	data and knowledge representation,
-	natural language processing,
-	query languages and information retrieval,
-	reasoning systems,
-	machine learning and classification

as well as the enthousiasm to cope with state of the art techniques for the extraction, 
structuring and management of semantic annotation, from both machine and human collaboration 
perspective. The purpose of the targeted research should enable the research group’s visions 
for multi-lingual concept based search and information retrieval, future TV and multimedia 
retrieval, the Big Data perspective, as well as their applications to smart cities and societies, 
bio- and social sciences, the Web, cognitive semantics and psychology.
