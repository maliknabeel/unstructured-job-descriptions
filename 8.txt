\f0\b\fs36 \cf0 Postdoc Positions in Semantic Web at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri720\qj

\f1\b0\fs22 \cf0 Two postdoctoral positions are available at the NICHE Research Group, Faculty of Computer Science for conducting research in the areas of semantic web with an applied focus in healthcare. In broad terms, the research program will cover semantic web research for knowledge modelling, decision support and data analytics. The research program is driven by a major (5-year) industry-funded project that involves the development and deployment of computerized decision support systems for the management of cardiovascular diseases. Semantic web research will be conducted to achieve (a) the modelling and execution of paper-based clinical guidelines, and (b) the modelling of institution-specific clinical processes to design and execute computerized clinical workflows. The decision support systems will be deployed for clinical use in healthcare institutions across the province and their efficacy will be evaluated through an major clinical trial. \
\
The research program offers excellent opportunities for pursuing innovative and practical interdisciplinary research at the cross-section of semantic web, health informatics, knowledge management and data analytics; with additional exposure to services oriented architectures, mobile computing and cloud computing. This is a collaborative research project with other partners including researchers/practitioners from the domains of health (cardiology, research methods, health systems, health education), health informatics and computer science. We are assembling a large team that will comprise researchers, post-docs, research assistants and graduate students (PhD and Masters). \
