description: Vested Ventures is a web incubator for the ideas of Steve Poland, former TechCrunch contributor. The business is a 1-man virtual operation that makes use of contractors. There are several consumer web app projects planned for '09, with one that is ready to be built-out right now. 

Passion for the web, a must. Passion for social media, a must. Passion for simplicity, a must.

Seeking an experienced programmer (for freelance/contract) to write a web app in either PHP or Ruby on Rails; must be experienced in AJAX/JavaScript; must be experienced in use of Amazon EC2/S3; you'll be implementing Aurigma (photo uploader; simple java applet. No prior exp necessary) and PayPal (for subscriptions). The graphic design is done, the screen mockups are done (aka what pages exist; what elements exist on each page; what functionality occurs on each page). The PSD's need to be cutup (which we can take care of) and then the application programmed.

Seeking someone experienced with working on "web 2.0" web apps, social media, and an understanding of the information architecture / workflows / viral-factor for top consumer web apps.
