A Postdoctoral Research Fellow position is available within the EPSRC-funded project “The Uncertainty of Identity: Linking Spatiotemporal Information Between Virtual and Real Worlds”.

The goal of this project is to investigate models, algorithms, systems and tools for geographic and social network analysis extracted from massive data sets.

This is an exciting opportunity for conducting ground-breaking interdisciplinary research at the interface of large-scale data mining, machine learning, mobile systems, and complex networks/network science. The project will be conducted in collaboration with the other partners of the projects including researchers at University College London, City University London, Purdue University, Arizona State University and several governmental organisations. There is also funding for research visits to the United States.

To apply you must hold a first degree in the areas of Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Electronic Engineering or a related discipline, and normally, a PhD relevant to the research area or equivalent qualifications. Also, you should have demonstrated your research competence through high-quality and high-impact publications in top conferences and journals in one (or more) of the following areas: data mining, machine learning, large-scale data processing and systems, mobile systems, and/or complex networks/network science.

Informal enquiries may be made to Dr Mirco Musolesi (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~musolesm/) at the School of Computer Science.
