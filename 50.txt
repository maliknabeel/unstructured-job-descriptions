Job Description:

Postdoctoral Fellow position in Computer Science at Tulane University

Tulane University is re-establishing a computer science program with the goal of developing a strong interdisciplinary research focus and an innovative curriculum. As part of this effort, we are soliciting applications for a 2-year postdoctoral researcher position. The successful candidate will work with Professor Carola Wenk.

Dr. Wenk works in computational geometry, with interests in shape matching, geospatial data analysis, and computational biology. Applicants seeking to work in these areas will have excellent training opportunities in core computer science areas and in interfacing areas (discrete mathematics, geographic information science, biomedicine, proteomics), and will also have ample opportunity to participate in teaching activities as the curriculum is re-established.

A complete application should include a CV, a statement of research interests, and three letters of reference. The application deadline is January 31, 2013; applications received thereafter will be considered until the position is filled. The ideal start date for this position is flexible, but is ideally Spring/Fall 2013. For more information and to apply, please go to our website at https://tulanejobs.tulane.edu.

Tulane University is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity/ADA Employer that is committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty. We therefore encourage applications from underrepresented groups.

If you have any questions please contact Carola Wenk at cwenk@tulane.edu.
