description:  New TV product and Project manager
If you are bubbling over with ideas; love and live technology; are self-motivated; enjoy a good spirited debate; are constantly thinking one year ahead; want early access to cutting edge technology; have been called insatiably curious and articulate; and want to see your own ideas come to fruition you should be talking with us. We are Orange Labs San Francisco.
We are looking for a candidate that brings an entrepreneurial attitude, has a driven desire to be innovative, goes beyond simple task execution and is inspired to networking in the valley through conferences, seminars, and other business means.
Orange Labs San Francisco is the Bay Area’s division of one of the world’s largest corporate research and development organizations. The San Francisco lab’s mission is to anticipate, develop, explore and research technologies and business models coming from the Silicon Valley. Among the labs projects is the drive to create novel consumer services for the converged web, mobile and television markets. The lab has a startup-like atmosphere with small teams working on innovative ideas.
Unlike many corporate research departments, Orange Labs San Francisco is charged with bringing ideas from concept to working prototype. Yet, projects are still mostly engineering driven and proactively marketed internally to our business units for rapid deployment (trials and commercial deployments).
Description:
If you believe

    That TV over internet in form of Hulu and Netflix is just too primitive?
    That the power of social media is under utilized in today's Internet TV.
    That "Over the Top" is just beginning of TV every where.
    That projects going on at companies as big as Comcast (Comcast Interactive Media) and AT&T's Entertainment services division and as innovative as Boxee are fascinating but they still seem too constrained because they are market focused rather then dream focused
